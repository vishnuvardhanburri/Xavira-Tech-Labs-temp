Hi Jeff,

An architectural review of Paymentology's platform stack surfaced a key operational bottleneck under load.

Your stack relies on Lume platform,  APIs,  Cloud. Specifically, the pattern surrounding TBD (Ready for Technical Diagnostics Pipeline) presents a significant risk under load. Under peak scaling surges, tbd (ready for technical diagnostics pipeline) introduces severe latency degradation and cascading worker backpressure.

If unmitigated during peak traffic spikes, this issue directly causes service degradation and SLA breaches.

I documented the exact failure mechanism and our recommended persistence isolation strategies in an independent Engineering Intelligence report: https://www.xaviratechlabs.com/research/paymentology

Let me know if you're available for a brief technical discussion to review our architectural solutions.
