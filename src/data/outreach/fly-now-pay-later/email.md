Hi Jasper,

During an examination of Fly Now Pay Later's core engineering layer... one specific observation stood out.

Your stack relies on MySQL,  Moment.js,  cdnjs. The pattern around TBD (Ready for Technical Diagnostics Pipeline) caught my attention. In high-throughput environments, managing throughput boundaries under scaling team volume requires careful isolation.

My interpretation could be off if your team has abstracted this persistence layer.

I documented the reasoning and potential scaling mitigations in an independent report here: https://www.xaviratechlabs.com/research/fly-now-pay-later

Open to your feedback if I've misread the public signals.
