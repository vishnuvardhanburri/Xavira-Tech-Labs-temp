Hi James,

Inspecting Oxbury's runtime infrastructure revealed a performance degradation boundary that requires immediate attention.

Your stack relies on Cloud-based solutions,  Naqoda core banking system. Specifically, the pattern surrounding TBD (Ready for Technical Diagnostics Pipeline) presents a significant risk under load. Under peak scaling surges, tbd (ready for technical diagnostics pipeline) introduces severe latency degradation and cascading worker backpressure.

Unmitigated at your current growth trajectory, this constraint will force emergency architectural refactoring.

I documented the exact failure mechanism and our recommended persistence isolation strategies in an independent Engineering Intelligence report: https://www.xaviratechlabs.com/research/oxbury

Are you open to a brief technical review to discuss how leading teams resolve this specific failure mode?
