Hi Oege,

Looking closely at XBOW's data pipeline layout... one specific observation stood out.

Your stack relies on Python,  LLMs,  JavaScript. The pattern around TBD (Ready for Technical Diagnostics Pipeline) caught my attention. In high-throughput environments, managing throughput boundaries under scaling team volume requires careful isolation.

My interpretation could be off if your team has abstracted this persistence layer.

I documented the reasoning and potential scaling mitigations in an independent report here: https://www.xaviratechlabs.com/research/xbow

Open to your feedback if I've misread the public signals.
