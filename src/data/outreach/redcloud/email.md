Hi Justin,

In reviewing RedCloud's system architecture footprint... one specific observation stood out.

Your stack relies on RedAI,  Machine Learning,  Cloud. The pattern around TBD (Ready for Technical Diagnostics Pipeline) caught my attention. In high-throughput environments, managing throughput boundaries under scaling team volume requires careful isolation.

You may already have mitigated this at the proxy or caching tier.

I documented the reasoning and potential scaling mitigations in an independent report here: https://www.xaviratechlabs.com/research/redcloud

Happy to be corrected if my reading of your architecture is off.
