Hi Justin,

Evaluating ClearScore's backend services identified a critical throughput constraint in your current architecture.

Your stack relies on AWS,  Java,  Spring Boot. Specifically, the pattern surrounding TBD (Ready for Technical Diagnostics Pipeline) presents a significant risk under load. Under peak scaling surges, tbd (ready for technical diagnostics pipeline) introduces severe latency degradation and cascading worker backpressure.

Without proper boundary isolation, this bottleneck degrades overall cluster throughput and inflates cloud infrastructure costs.

I documented the exact failure mechanism and our recommended persistence isolation strategies in an independent Engineering Intelligence report: https://www.xaviratechlabs.com/research/clearscore

Are you available for a 15-minute briefing to go over these findings with your platform team?
