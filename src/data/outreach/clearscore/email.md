Hi Justin,

Looking into the technical stack at ClearScore... one specific observation stood out.

Your stack relies on AWS,  Java,  Spring Boot. The pattern around TBD (Ready for Technical Diagnostics Pipeline) caught my attention. In high-throughput environments, managing throughput boundaries under scaling team volume requires careful isolation.

You may already have mitigated this at the proxy or caching tier.

I documented the reasoning and potential scaling mitigations in an independent report here: https://www.xaviratechlabs.com/research/clearscore

Happy to be corrected if my reading of your architecture is off.
